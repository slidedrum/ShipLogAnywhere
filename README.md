# ShipLogAnywhere

A mod for Outer Wilds that allows you to use your ship log anywhere!  Press the auto pilot key to open it.  The main difference between this and Suit Log is instead of re-implementing the log, it is a direct view from your ship.  Meaning full compatability with custom ship modes or (probably) any other mod!
